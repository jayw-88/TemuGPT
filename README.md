# TemuGPT
A small project I made that uses Streamlit to run an "AI".
This "AI" uses the Gemini API, and this project was made just for me to experiment with API's and Streamlit.

# DISCLAIMER
Please do not abuse this AI in any way. Only use it to assist you, not to baby you.

## How to run on Streamlit
