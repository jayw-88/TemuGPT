#Welcome to TemuGPT -_-
#Do not touch the code unless you know what you are doing!
#You were supposed to make a copy of this code if you want to edit it; do not edit the my original version.
#There are small pauses in the code to make the AI feel less rushed; if you want to get rid of this find all time.sleep() functions and delete them.
#I am working on a TemuGPT version that uses Tkinter to have an actual application with GUI instead of just a console. Mkae sure to check that out when I am finished with it.
